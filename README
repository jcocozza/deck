# deck
Write your presentations as plain text files.
Each paragraph is its own slide.

deck is inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/sent/
It has much of the same basic syntax
I just added some more fluff on top

# Features:
- two modes: auto and pretty
- auto:
    - scales and centers text (even on resize)
    - lists are automatically left aligned
    - one font, one size
    - optionally colored if specified in theme config
    - auto mode will look bad if you aren't intentional with your content
    keeping you from doing stupid presentations

# Features con't
- pretty:
    - optionally colored if specified in theme config
    - size text groups (e.g. headers, subheaders,...) with theme config

# Features con't con't
- quite simple: only ~1200 lines of code
- works well with markdown files
    - use "# " for headers, "## " for subheaders
- relatively robust.
    - an arbitrary text file might not be condusive to the plain text presentation
    - deck can create presentations out of most text files.
    - (try turing your code into a presentation)
- pipe into deck, and read from more then one file at a time
    - e.g. deck < foo.txt
    - e.g. deck foo.txt bar.txt
- import images into your deck (simply reference them with "@")
    - images can be aligned @[l/r/t/b]:path/to/image for left right top and bottom respectively.
    - using just @path/to/image will center the image
    - only 1 image per slide, but can add additional text

# Finally:
This README is actually a presentation.
After you've built deck just run deck README to see it.
