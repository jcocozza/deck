# deck
Write your presentations as plain text files.
Each paragraph is its own slide.

deck is inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/sent/.
It has much of the same basic syntax.
I just added some more fluff on top.

# Features:
- works well with markdown files
    - use "# " for headers, "## " for subheaders
- supports pptx themes and fonts
- import images into your deck (simply reference them with "@")
- relatively robust.
    - Although an arbitrary text file might not be condusive to the paragraph <-> slide format, deck can still create presentations out of most text files.
    - (try turing your code into a presentation)
- pipe into deck, and read from more then one file at a time
    - e.g. cat foo.txt | deck
    - e.g. deck foo.txt bar.txt

# Finally:
This README is actually a presentation.
After you've built deck just run deck README to see it.
