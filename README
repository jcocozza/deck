Presentation

A presentation tool inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/sent/.
Same basic syntax with just a bit more fluff on top.

Write your presentations a plain text files.

Features:
- supports pptx themes and fonts
- import images, and even other files into your deck
- relatively robust. will accept most text files (try turing your code into a presentation)
- pipe in input, read from more then one file at a time.

Coming Soon:
