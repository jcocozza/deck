# <tool name>
Write your presentations as plain text files.
Each paragraph is its own slide.

<tool name> is inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/sent/.
It has much of the same basic syntax. But has some more fluff on top.

# Features:
- works well with markdown files
    - use "# " for headers, "## " for subheaders
- supports pptx themes and fonts
- import images, and even other files into your deck (simply reference them with "@" on their own line)
- relatively robust. will accept most text files (try turing your code into a presentation)
- pipe in input, read from more then one file at a time.

# Coming Soon:
@TODO

# Finally:
This README is actually a presentation.
After you've built <tool name> just run <tool name> README to see it.
