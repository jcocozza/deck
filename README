# deck
Write your presentations as plain text files.
Each paragraph is its own slide.

deck is inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/sent/.
It reads text files in most of the same way as sent, but I added some fluff on top.

# Features:
- two "modes": auto and pretty

# Mode: auto:
    - this is the default mode
    - scales and centers text (even on resize)
    - lists are automatically left aligned
    - one font, one size
    - optionally colored
        - can use default colors with the `colorize` flag
    - auto mode will look bad if you aren't intentional with your content
      keeping you from doing stupid presentations

# Mode: pretty:
    - optionally colored if specified in theme config
    - size text groups (e.g. headers, subheaders,...) with theme config

# CLI Basics
- `-theme <theme_name>`: empty or "default" theme will use the defaults
    - empty: the empty theme will just use black text and white background for everything
    - "default": the default theme uses some basic coloring
- `-colorize`: determines the fallback theme when using custom themes
    - when included, fallback is the the basic coloring scheme
    - when not included, fallback is just black text on a white background
- `-no-scale`: turns off auto mode and makes deck respect theme sizes

# Features con't
- quite simple: only ~1200 lines of code
- works well with markdown files
    - use "# " for headers, "## " for subheaders
- relatively robust.
    - an arbitrary text file might not be condusive to the plain text presentation
    - but, deck can create presentations out of most text files
    - (try turing your code into a presentation)
- pipe into deck, and read from more then one file at a time
    - e.g. deck < foo.txt
    - e.g. deck foo.txt bar.txt
- import images into your deck (simply reference them with "@")
    - images can be aligned @[l/r/t/b]:path/to/image for left right top and bottom respectively.
    - using just @path/to/image will center the image
    - only 1 image per slide, but can add additional text

# Finally:
This README is actually a presentation.
After you've built deck just run deck README to see it.
