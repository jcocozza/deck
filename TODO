- support logo (upper right hand corner)
- slide numbers (lower right hand corner)
- correctly wrap lines (i think this is a no go- this should be user managed)
- add optional auto scale ability
- write to pptx
- left, center and right align images should be easy to support
    - maybe prefix can be @[l/c/r]@path/to/file
    - but also leave default option of @path/to/file
- cli
    - allow theme specification (via path)
    - allow font specification (via path)
- Terminal mode?
    - support terminal presentations/piping to stdout
- what to do when nothing passed in
    - i think this should generate an empty slide show with one slide
