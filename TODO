- fully flesh out theme config file
- cli
    - allow theme specification (via path)
    - allow font specification (via path)

- support reading in text files
    - this will require an abstraction over the image in the slide
- support logo (upper right hand corner)
- slide numbers (lower right (or left?) hand corner)
- more color matching:
    - can we do basic code syntax highlighting?
    - coloring is out of scope, but we could change format inside ``'s

- Terminal mode?
    - support terminal presentations/piping to stdout
- what to do when nothing passed in
    - i think this should generate an empty slide show with one slide
