- fully flesh out theme config file
- cli
    - allow theme specification (via path)
    - allow font specification (via path)

- support logo (upper right hand corner)
- slide numbers (lower right (or left?) hand corner)
- Terminal mode?
    - support terminal presentations/piping to stdout
- what to do when nothing passed in
    - i think this should generate an empty slide show with one slide
